problem = """Two water taps together can fill a tank in 9 3/8 hours. The tap of larger diameter takes 10 hours less  than the smaller one to fill the tank separately.Find the time in which each tap can separately fill the tank
"""
solution = """
Let the time taken by the smaller pipe to fill the tank be x hr.
Time taken by the larger pipe = (x - 10) hr
Part of tank filled by smaller pipe in 1 hour = 1/x
Part of tank filled by larger pipe in 1 hour = 1/(x - 10)

According to the problem, both pipes together can fill the tank in 9 3/8 hours, which is 75/8 hours. So, the part of the tank they can fill in 1 hour is 8/75.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
1/x + 1/(x - 10) = 8/75
=> (x-10 + x)/ [x(x - 10)] = 8/75
=> (2x - 10) / [x(x - 10)] = 8/75
=> 75(2x - 10) = 8x(x - 10)
=> 150x - 750 = 8x^2 - 80x
=> 8x^2 - 230x + 750 = 0
=> 8x^2 - 200x -30x + 750 = 0
=> 8x(x-25) - 30(x-25) = 0
=> (x-25)(8x-30) = 0
=> x = 25, 30/8


Time taken by the smaller pipe cannot be 30/8 = 3.75 hours. As in this case, the time taken by the larger pipe will be negative, which is logically not possible.
Therefore, time taken individually by the smaller pipe and the larger pipe will be 25 and 25 - 10 =15 hours respectively.

problem2 = """
In an arithmetic progression, the sum of the first n terms is 300 and the sum of first 2n terms is 1200. Find the ratio of the sum of first 13 terms and sum of first 7 terms of the A.P.
"""
solution2 = """
According to the question,

(n/2) * [2a + (n-1)d] = 300....(1)

(2n/2) * [2a + (2n-1)d] = 1200....(2)

Dividing equation (1) by equation (2), we get

[(2a + (n-1)d) / (2 * (2a + (2n-1)d))] = 300/1200 = 1/4

This simplifies to 4a + 2(n-1)d = 2a + (2n-1)d

Rearranging terms, we get 2(2-1)a = d

So, 2a = d

The ratio of the sum of the first 13 terms to the sum of the first 7 terms is

[(13/2) * (2a + (13-1)d)] / [(7/2) * (2a + (7-1)d)] = [13 * (2a + (13-1) * 2a)] / [7 * (2a + (7-1) * 2a)] = 169/49
